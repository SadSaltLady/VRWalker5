# How to use Server.py
 - connect your computer and headset to the same wifi
 - open up the Python file, around line 50 or so there's a 'TCP_IP' variable
 - find out what's your computer's ip address and put it there (for windows, run ipconfig in cmd window and it would be the IPv4 address)
 - change that value to the IPv4 address
 - Test if it boots up by doing python server.py and see if it runs
 - in engine, there should some corresponding IP address variable, change it to fit the new value
 - when you deploy app onto the headset and boot it up, you should see a notification pop up in the terminal.
